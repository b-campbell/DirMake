# DirMake
An API to create directories in python, automatically numbering duplicate directories.

DirMake is a simple tool I created to help with managing names of folders when dynamically creating directories. Where normally you would need to check whether a directory exists first, this short script instead finds the next available unique name in the pattern of DIRNAME(x). It returns the name of the directory it created so you can use the dynamically created directory in your programm successfully.
